# Terraform module for S3 hosted website with password

While this is a functional module, it's probably not very useful as is.
It was built as sample code for a [tutorial](https://www.noobs.quest/devops/password-protected-s3/)
and is not very configurable. Feel free to fork, build on it and publish
it as a configurable module that could just be hooked into an existing
Terraform configuration.
